Coursework and laboratory files for the UofT Blockchain Engineering course

## HW1 - Bitcoin Implementation
This Q&A focusses on the details of the implementation of Bitcoin (and Script language) according to the [original Bitcoin whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf).

Read it [here](https://github.com/PsiPhiTheta/Blockchain-Labs/blob/master/hw/hw1/Homework1.pdf).

## HW2 - ZenCash, Verge, Bitcoin Gold & ERC20 Security Attacks
This Q&A focusses on security attack case studies in ZenCash, Verge, Bitcoin Gold and ERC20 tokens (BeautyChain). The detailed implementation of the [Ethereum whitepaper](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper) is also covered (and the Solidity language). 

Read it [here](https://github.com/PsiPhiTheta/Blockchain-Labs/blob/master/hw/hw2/Homework2.pdf).

## HW3 - Mining, Pools & Block Witholding Attacks
This Q&A focusses on [mining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency#Mining), the emergence of [mining pools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining_pool) and block witholding attacks (Lie in Wait, Selfish Mining & Finney attacks).

Read it [here](https://github.com/PsiPhiTheta/Blockchain-Labs/blob/master/hw/hw3/Homework3.pdf).

## HW4 - PoW Consensus Algorithms
This Q&A focusses on the [Proof-of-Work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-work_system) consensus algorithm implemented in the Bitcoin blockchain and in many other blockchains.

Read it [here](https://github.com/PsiPhiTheta/Blockchain-Labs/blob/master/hw/hw4/Homework4.pdf).

## HW5 - Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance
This Q&A focusses on the Practical [Byzantine Fault Tolerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) problem and its consensus solutions, in particular in [Tendermint](https://tendermint.com/static/docs/tendermint.pdf). 

Read it [here](https://github.com/PsiPhiTheta/Blockchain-Labs/blob/master/hw/hw5/Homework5.pdf).
