## HW4 - PoW Consensus Algorithms
This homework focusses on the [Proof-of-Work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-work_system) consensus algorithm implemented in Bitcoin and many other blockchains.

## HW5 - Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance
This homework focusses on the Practical [Byzantine Fault Tolerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) problem and its consensus solutions, in particular in [Tendermint](https://tendermint.com/static/docs/tendermint.pdf).
