Coursework and laboratory files for the UofT Blockchain Engineering course

## HW1 - Fundamentals: Bitcoin
This Q&A focusses on the details of the implementation of Bitcoin (and Script language) according to the [original Bitcoin whitepaper](https://bitcoin.org/bitcoin.pdf).

Read it [here](https://github.com/PsiPhiTheta/Blockchain-Labs/blob/master/hw/hw1/Homework1.pdf).

## HW2 - Security (I): ZenCash, Verge, Bitcoin Gold & ERC20 
This Q&A focusses on security attack case studies in ZenCash, Verge, Bitcoin Gold and ERC20 tokens (BeautyChain). The detailed implementation of the [Ethereum whitepaper](https://github.com/ethereum/wiki/wiki/White-Paper) is also covered (and the Solidity language). 

Read it [here](https://github.com/PsiPhiTheta/Blockchain-Labs/blob/master/hw/hw2/Homework2.pdf).

## HW3 - Security (II): Mining, Pools & Block Witholding Attacks (BTC, ETH, LTX, XMR, ZEC)
This Q&A focusses on [mining](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cryptocurrency#Mining), the emergence of [mining pools](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mining_pool) and block witholding attacks (Lie in Wait, Selfish Mining & Finney attacks).

Read it [here](https://github.com/PsiPhiTheta/Blockchain-Labs/blob/master/hw/hw3/Homework3.pdf).

## HW4 - Consensus (I): Traditional PoW (Bitcoin)
This Q&A focusses on the [Proof-of-Work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-work_system) consensus algorithm implemented in the Bitcoin blockchain and in many other blockchains.

Read it [here](https://github.com/PsiPhiTheta/Blockchain-Labs/blob/master/hw/hw4/Homework4.pdf).

## HW5 - Consensus (II): Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance (PBFT and Tendermint) 
This Q&A focusses on the Practical [Byzantine Fault Tolerance](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Byzantine_fault_tolerance) problem and its consensus solutions, in particular in [Tendermint](https://tendermint.com/static/docs/tendermint.pdf). 

Read it [here](https://github.com/PsiPhiTheta/Blockchain-Labs/blob/master/hw/hw5/Homework5.pdf).

## HW6 - Consensus (III): Memory-Hard PoW (Ethash and Equihash) 
This Q&A focusses on alternative memory-hard [Proof-of-Work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-work_system) algorithms implemented in Bitcoin competitors like Ethereum (using [Ethash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ethash) PoW) and Zcash (using [Equihash](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Equihash) PoW).

Read it [here](https://github.com/PsiPhiTheta/Blockchain-Labs/blob/master/hw/hw6/Homework6.pdf).

## HW7 - Consensus (IV): Scalable PoW, PoS and BA* (GHOST, Conflux and Algorand)
This Q&A focusses on alternative consensus algorithms to the Nakamoto Consensus in [Proof-of-Work](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Proof-of-work_system). The algorithms examined are [GHOST](https://eprint.iacr.org/2013/881.pdf), [Conflux](https://arxiv.org/abs/1805.03870) and [Algorand](https://people.csail.mit.edu/nickolai/papers/gilad-algorand-eprint.pdf).

Read it [here](https://github.com/PsiPhiTheta/Blockchain-Labs/blob/master/hw/hw7/Homework7.pdf).

## HW8 - Consensus (V): Off-Chain PoW, PoS, PoR, PoRep and PoSt (Bitcoin Lightning and Filecoin)
This Q&A focusses on alternative consensus algorithms such as the off-chain PoW in [Bitcoin Lightning](https://lightning.network/lightning-network-paper.pdf) and PoS, PoR, PoRep and PoSt in [Filecoin](https://filecoin.io/filecoin.pdf).

Read it [here](https://github.com/PsiPhiTheta/Blockchain-Labs/blob/master/hw/hw8/Homework8.pdf).

## HW9 - Privacy & Fungibility: Monero and ZCash
This Q&A focusses on the implementation of privacy and fungibility in the [Monero](https://whitepaperdatabase.com/monero-xmr-whitepaper/) and [ZCash](http://zerocash-project.org/media/pdf/zerocash-extended-20140518.pdf) implementations (including use of [zkSNARK](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Non-interactive_zero-knowledge_proof)).
